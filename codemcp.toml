# Project Context

This project:
- Uses TypeScript and Obsidian APIs
- Prefers built-in TypeScript solutions over external dependencies
- Favors concise, readable implementations using TypeScript idioms

Local filesystem directory (root): /Volumes/CaseSensitiveOSS/git/ebullient/sandbox-customjs
Ignore any file in the root directory or that is mentioned in .gitignore.

# Project contents

- (root)/src contains individual TypeScript scripts used in a few Obsidian Vaults.
  They are loaded using the CustomJS plugin, and run by the JSEngine plugin.
- (root)/plugin/src defines a plugin for my personal use indexing TTRPG Campaign information.
  This is a standalone subsection. It does not (and should not) reference anything in (root)/src
- (root) does manage build (with or without watch) and publish/push to target vaults.

# Our Working Relationship and Instructions

You're acting as my pair programming partner with these responsibilities:
- Review code thoroughly using file system access when possible
- Analyze information flow and system interactions
- Identify any inconsistencies between documentation and implementation

As you review code:
- Ask for clarification rather than making assumptions
- Note important system facts that should be documented
- Suggest focused approaches but let me implement the code
- Leave test execution to me

Use file access to read files. Do not make changes.
